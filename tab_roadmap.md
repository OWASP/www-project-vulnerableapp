## Roadmap
### Vision for the project:

The overall vision for the project is to implement a Platform capability such that it is easier to write 
vulnerable code and exposing that through an API and UI. 

### Usage of the project:

This Project mainly targets 4 type of audience:
* Developers of Vulnerability Scanning tools
* New Vulnerability finders (for faster demonstration of the vulnerability)
* Security enthusiasts, Students who want to learn more about Security
* CTF organizers (A Platform to Host CTF by choosing vulnerabilities present in the project)

### Initial high level plan:

Milestone 1: Alpha release - Building extensible backend Platform


Milestone 2: Beta release - Building extensible User Interface


Milestore 3: Gamma release - Addition of 50 vulnerabilities using the above mentioned Platform

Milestone 4: Release 1


Milestone 5 - Dev lifecycle integration


### Timeframes
This is hard to estimate as this depends on the number of contributers but as of now i had already build some of the pieces of Backend
platform and i have started building frontend platform but addition of 50 vulnerabilities can take quite a lot time. So Plan is to 
release this Project is near July 31 2020.

### Technology
